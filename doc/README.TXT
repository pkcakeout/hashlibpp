0) About hashlib++?

hashlib++ is a simple and very easy to use library to create a cryptographic
checksum called "hash". hashlib++ is written in plain C++ and should work with
every compiler and platform. hashlib++ is released under the BSD-license (see
section 7) and therefore free software.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

1) Current version

The current stable version of hashlib++ is:  0.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

2) Supported hash functions  

hashlib++ is in a very early state, thus only two functions are supported at the
moment:

	* MD5	Message-Digest algorithm 5
	* SHA1  Secure Hash Algorithm 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

3) The structure of hashlib++

hashlib++ provides so called "wrappers" for each supported hash function which
simplify the creation of the relevant hash. Instead of implementing the full
algorithm for the hash function you only have to instantiate a desired wrapper
and call a memberfunction like getHashFromString() or getHashFromFile().  

TODO: see for more details

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

4) The library's files

The library consist of the the following files:

	* hashwrapper.h
	  This is a baseclass of all wrappers.

	* md5.h and md5.cpp
	  These two files implement the MD5 algorithm. 
	
	* md5wrapper.h and md5wrapper.cpp
	  These files represents the MD5 wrapper. 
	  Use this wrapper to easily create a MD5 hash.
	
        * sha1.h and sha1.cpp
	  These two files implement the SHA1 algorithm. 
	
	* sha1wrapper.h and sha1wrapper.cpp
	  These files represents the SHA1 wrapper. 
	  Use this wrapper to easily create a SHA1 hash.
	
	* libtest.cpp
	  This is a example program which shows how to 
	  use hashlib++. The program expected a filename
	  or a string and creates the SHA1 and MD5 hash
	  of the given file or characters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

5) Using hashlib++

This section explains how to create a hash with the help of hashlib++.  First of
all you have to include the baseclass "hashwrapper.h" and the headerfile of the
wrapper you want to use:

	#include "hashwrapper.h"
	#include "sha1wrapper.h"
	#include "md5wrapper.h"

After that you can create wrapper objects:

	hashwrapper *md5 = new md5wrapper();
	hashwrapper *sha1 = new sha1wrapper();

Once a wrapper has been instantiated, you can basically call the memberfunctions
getHashFromFile() and getHashFromString() to create a hash from a file or
string.

	std::string mytexthash = md5->getHashFromString("Hello World");
	std::string myfilehash = md5->getHashFromFile("README.TXT");

And that's all! 

	delete md5;
	delete sha1;

Now you can add the corresponding *.cpp files (For MD5 for example: md5.cpp and
md5wrapper.cpp) to your project and start compiling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
  
6) Supported operation systems

hashlib++ was written in standard C++, so it is platform independent and
should work with every C++ compiler. It was tested on the following systems
which are official supported:

	FreeBSD 6.2 with g++ 3.4.6
	Microsoft Windows XP with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition
	Gnu/Linux 2.6 with g++ 3.4.6
